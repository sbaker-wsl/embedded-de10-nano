This repository is meant to save my progress working through the Embedded Linux section of the Altera University Project for the DE-10 Nano. Each folder contains the instructions
for that lab number as well as my code for the associated parts. I completed this for learning purposes associated with my work with Stephan Ohl for a research project with the
University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown.

All laboratory exercises can be found here:
